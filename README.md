### COMP 1073 – Client-Side JavaScript

# LAB 6
## World’s Best Burger

#### DESCRIPTION
Using the code provided, create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object.

#### INSTRUCTIONS
Observe carefully the last function that we created together in the in-class lesson (oop.html). Using this as your guide, create your own function (2 marks) that would allow for the creation of any number of interesting hamburgers. 

Consider that a hamburger has many options (7 marks) – that might include
- different types of buns,
- vegetable garnishes,
- assortments of cheeses,
- specialty sauces,
- different meat patties (beef, chicken, vegetarian),
- single, double, or triple patty,
- Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.

Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too (1 mark). Have fun!

Note:
You will have to create a new .js file. You can keep the file in a new "js" directory. The file can have any name that you like but make sure to include it in your html file.
